# The Employee That Worked on the Longest Task

There are n employees, each with a unique id from 0 to n - 1.

You are given a 2D integer array logs where logs[i] = [id_i, leaveTime_i] where:

id_i is the id of the employee that worked on the ith task, and
leaveTime_i is the time at which the employee finished the ith task. All the values leaveTime_i are unique.
Note that the ith task starts the moment right after the (i - 1)th task ends, and the 0th task starts at time 0.

Return the id of the employee that worked the task with the longest time. If there is a tie between two or more employees, return the smallest id among them.
